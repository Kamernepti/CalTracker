# CalTracker
Solo Project: Food log site that a user can log in to keep track of calories from both food and exercise.  The dashboard also keeps track of the user's weight and activity on the site.  Eventual functionality will allow users to post messages to one another, view profiles for other users, and read blogs posted to the site.

- ability to register and login
- user dashboard that stores food and exercise for the day

- dashboard stores most recent weight with ability to update
- the dashboard displays the total calories from food and exercise for the day

Next functionality:

- profile that can be individualized
- forum that allows users to post messages and comments viewable by other users
- blog section with blogs viewable by all users
- edit feature added to the dashboard for food and exercise
